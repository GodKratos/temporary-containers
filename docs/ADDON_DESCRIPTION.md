**Enhance your privacy** with automatic container isolation that prevents cross-site tracking and protects your personal data while browsing.

This is a continuation of the original [Temporary Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/) addon. **Migrating users**: Export preferences from the old addon and import them here. You may need to manually remove previous tmp containers.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Mode** - Every new tab opens in an isolated temporary container
- **Smart Isolation** - Configure how links open based on your privacy needs
- **Enterprise Ready** - Full managed storage support for organizations
- **Container Cleanup** - Containers automatically delete after specified time
- **Multi-Account Integration** - Works alongside Firefox's Multi-Account Containers

## Privacy Benefits

**Prevents Cross-Site Tracking**: Each website loads in its own isolated container, blocking trackers from following you across sites.

**Protects Personal Data**: Cookies, localStorage, and session data stay isolated within each container.

**Enhanced Security**: Reduces attack surface by compartmentalizing browsing sessions.
